Notes
1. Turing Test & AI
A system passes the Turing test if interacting with it is indistinguishable from interacting with a computer
The goal of ML is to mimic human response but not human intelligent without being explicitly programmed
Example - Snowing or Raining based on temperature
Example - Iris Flowers dataset
